Android hackathon to make an app out of http://m.safelyhome.westerncape.gov.za/reporter We didn't finish but 2 teams got quite far. Lookout for another meet to finish/polish and submit the app.
Good fun and learning in the process. https://github.com/maiatoday/safely-home and https://github.com/GDGCapeTown/TrafficOffenceReporter
