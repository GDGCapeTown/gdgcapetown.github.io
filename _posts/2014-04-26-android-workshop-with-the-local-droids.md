Android hackathon to make an app out of [Western Cape SafelyHome mobile website](http://m.safelyhome.westerncape.gov.za/reporter).
We didn't finish but two teams got quite far. Lookout for another meet to finish/polish and submit the app.
Good fun and learning in the process. Here are the projects: [Candidate app 1](https://github.com/maiatoday/safely-home) and [Candidate app 2](https://github.com/GDGCapeTown/TrafficOffenceReporter).
